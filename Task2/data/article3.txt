How much protein, carbohydrates, and fats should you eat for a healthy meal plan? These charts can show you what your goal should be in calories and in grams for each macronutrient. You can read nutrition labels or use a macro tracking app to add them up each day.

First, determine what your daily calorie goal should be. You can use a daily caloric needs calculator to find how many calories your body burns each day. If you want to lose weight, you should aim for a number that is 500 fewer calories per day than your daily caloric needs.1

Carbohydrate and protein each contribute 4 calories per gram, while fat contributes 9 calories per gram.

Choosing a Weight-Loss Diet
People have weight loss success with different kinds of meal plans. Some do very well with a high protein diet, while others prefer to follow a Mediterranean-style, vegetarian, or a typical low-calorie diet.

These charts are based on three healthy diets modeled by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and a high-protein 40-30-30 diet.

If you are training for an endurance event such as a half-marathon, marathon, or century cycling ride, athletic trainers usually recommend using one of the three diets with higher carbohydrates rather than the high protein but low carb diet. You need carbohydrates to burn for energy during endurance exercise.

Though these charts start out at 1,000 calories per day, it's important to note that the minimum calorie count recommended for adults is 1,800 calories per day for sedentary women and 2,400 calories per day for sedentary men.2 Only children and youth can eat lower calorie counts and still satisfy their nutritional needs. The number of calories that you need each day day will depend on your age, weight, height, activity level, and health goals.

U.S.-Style Diet Chart
The USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide percent ranges for each macronutrient. For adults, the organization recommends consuming 10% to 35% of calories from protein, 45% to 65% from carbohydrates, and 20% to 35% from fat.2 The guidelines also suggest consuming less than 10% of total calories from saturated fat.

The table below provides specific numbers for a diet that provides 51% of calories from carbohydrates, 18% from protein, and 33% from fat. It is appropriate for athletes, especially for people who enjoy endurance exercise, such as walking, hiking, running, and cycling. Depending on your needs, the macronutrient ranges may be different.

Vegetarian Diet Chart
According to the USDA, those following a healthy vegetarian eating plan should meet the same nutrient and Dietary Guidelines standards as the Healthy U.S.-style Pattern, so macronutrient ranges are the same. The difference between the two eating styles is the foods chosen within each food group.

For example, servings of protein foods such as meat and seafood are not included in the vegetarian plan. Rather, someone following a 2000-calorie-per-day vegetarian diet should try to consume 3.5-ounce equivalents of protein foods, including legumes, soy products, eggs, nuts, and seeds.2

The table below provides specific numbers for someone following a vegetarian diet that is 55% carbohydrate, 14% protein, and 34% fat. Depending on your needs, the macronutrient ranges may be different.

Pros and Cons of a Vegetarian Diet
Mediterranean-Style Diet Chart
According to the USDA, those following a Mediterranean-Style eating plan should meet the same nutrient standards as the Healthy U.S.-style Pattern. Again, the macronutrient ranges are the same.

The difference between the two eating patterns is that the Mediterranean-style diet contains more fruits and seafood and less dairy than the Healthy U.S.-style Pattern.

For example, the USDA recommends 15 ounce-equivalents per week of seafood for those following a 2000-calorie-per-day Mediterranean diet, but only 8 ounce-equivalents per week of seafood for those following the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern.2

The table below provides specific numbers for someone following a Mediterranean diet that is 52% carbohydrate, 18% protein, and 32% fat. Depending on your needs, the macronutrient ranges may be different.

Getting Started With the DASH Diet
40-30-30 Diet High Protein Chart
How can you measure how many grams of protein, carbs, and fat you should eat? A 40-30-30 diet is one in which you consume 40% of your calories from carbohydrates, 30% from protein, and 30% from fat. This chart is geared towards a high-protein diet, which may be helpful for those who want to gain muscle mass, but may not be appropriate for those with liver or kidney problems or when training for endurance exercise.
