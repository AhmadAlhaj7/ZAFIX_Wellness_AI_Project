🎯 Objective

Build a foundational AI content retrieval and reasoning engine that can read, understand, and summarize structured or unstructured text sources.

🧠 Core Logic

Goal: Enable the AI to process large documents and answer contextually relevant questions.

Module	Function
data_loader.py	Reads input documents (PDFs, text files) and converts them into text chunks.
embedding_generator.py	Converts chunks into vector embeddings using a transformer model.
vector_store.py	Saves embeddings in a retrievable format (FAISS, Chroma, etc.).
query_engine.py	Accepts user questions and finds the most relevant document chunks.
ai_reasoner.py	Uses an LLM to synthesize coherent answers from retrieved context.
⚙️ Workflow
User Query
   ↓
Query Engine → Retrieves relevant text chunks
   ↓
AI Reasoner → Synthesizes answer
   ↓
Response Output → Display summarized, context-aware information

🧩 Key Features

Local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow.

Modular, extendable pipeline (each part replaceable).

Configurable for both general knowledge and domain-specific data.
