🎯 Objective

Build a multi-tool agent system capable of integrating reasoning, memory, and adaptive recommendations based on health and behavioral data.

🧠 Core Logic
Module	Function
data_reader.py	Reads user metrics (sleep, stress, nutrition, etc.) from JSON/CSV.
data_analyzer.py	Detects trends, averages, and anomalies in data.
recommender.py	Generates personalized insights using rule-based reasoning or LLM.
health_agent.py	Central orchestrator managing workflow, reasoning, and tool coordination.
persistent_memory.py (optional)	Stores historical reports for adaptive learning.
⚙️ Workflow
User Data (JSON/CSV)
   ↓
Data Reader → Loads and validates metrics
   ↓
Data Analyzer → Finds patterns (e.g., stress ↑, sleep ↓)
   ↓
Recommender → Suggests personalized actions
   ↓
Health Agent → Generates summary report
   ↓
User / Dashboard → Output insights & recommendations

🧩 Example Flow

Input:

{
  "sleep_hours": 5.8,
  "stress_level": 8.1,
  "activity_score": 3.5,
  "nutrition_score": 6.4
}


Output:

⚠️ Pattern: High stress and insufficient recovery detected.
💡 Recommendation: Meditate 10 minutes, reduce caffeine intake, and take a 20-minute walk.

🧠 Agent Design Logic

Reactive Layer – Reads and analyzes new data.

Reasoning Layer – Interprets metrics to infer cause-effect relationships.

Adaptive Layer – Adjusts future advice based on memory of user progress.

🧩 Multi-Tool Integration
Tool	Description
🧾 Data Reader	File ingestion and validation
📊 Data Analyzer	Statistical & behavioral trend detection
💬 Recommendation Engine	Context-aware suggestions
🧠 Agent Orchestrator	Logic coordinator across modules
